## Glacial Bliss: Savor the Frost, Taste the Joy

**Overview**

Glacial Bliss is a dynamic and interactive web application designed for an ice cream restaurant. It also offers smoothies, cookies, biscuits, milkshakes, and falooda. The project utilizes Java Spring Boot for the robust backend and Angular with Bootstrap for the responsive and visually appealing frontend. It demonstrates full-stack development, integrating a powerful backend with a polished user interface.

**Project Objectives**

The project aims to develop a comprehensive web application for Glacial Bliss, an ice cream restaurant, with features like:

* **Product Management:** Allow users to browse and manage products from various categories.
* **Order Management:** Enable users to add items to their cart, checkout, and place orders.
* **User Management:** Facilitate user registration and authentication for managing orders and preferences (optional).
* **Responsive Design:** Ensure the application displays flawlessly across different devices.
* **Security:** Implement measures to protect user data and restrict unauthorized access.

**Technical Implementation**

* **Backend:** Developed using Java Spring Boot for efficient server-side operations and database interaction.
* **Database:** MySQL manages data, including tables for products, orders, and users (if implemented).
* **Frontend:** Built with Angular and Bootstrap 5.3.3 for a responsive and user-friendly interface. CSS enhances the visual appeal with styling, hover effects, and transitions.
* **Testing:** Postman rigorously tests backend APIs to ensure functionality before frontend integration.
* **Security:** User authentication and CORS configuration safeguard user data and restrict unauthorized access.

**Features**

* **Database Management:**
    * MySQL stores product, order, and user data (if applicable).
    * CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) manage product and order information.
    * CORS configuration (CorsConfig.java) facilitates cross-origin resource sharing.
* **Backend:**
    * Developed using Java Spring Boot.
    * Integrates with MySQL to manage Product, Order, and User entities (if applicable).
    * Implements comprehensive CRUD operations for products.
    * Validated using Postman for API functionality.
    * Configured pom.xml with Maven and necessary plugin configurations.
* **Frontend:**
    * Developed using Angular and Bootstrap 5.3.3 for a responsive UI.
    * Features a custom CSS-designed logo, hover effects, transitions, and background images from online sources.
    * The menu list utilizes pagination with hover zoom effects for a user-friendly experience.
    * Essential components like navbar, home, footer, product details, and product list are established initially, followed by cart, order, and user management (if applicable).
* **Functionality:**
    * Users browse products, add them to the cart, and proceed to checkout.
    * Payment options include "Pay Now" and "Cash on Delivery" (COD). Payment is restricted for non-registered users.
    * The responsive frontend adapts to the screen size without centering content.

**Project Structure**

* **Spring Boot Backend:**
    * **Entity Management:** Product, Order, and User entities (if applicable) are managed with proper table linking using @Table annotations.
    * **Controller:** Managed with @CrossOrigin(origins = "http://localhost:4200") for CORS handling.
    * **CORS Configuration:** Handled with CorsConfig.java.
    * **Maven Plugin:** Configured with maven-surefire-plugin for managing test failures.
* **MySQL Database:**
    * Database and tables are set up and configured within MySQL Workbench.
    * All backend operations are linked to corresponding MySQL entities.
* **Postman Testing:**
    * API endpoints are extensively tested using Postman to guarantee a  properly functioning backend.
* **Angular Frontend:**
    * HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap are used to design the user interface.
    * Components for navigation, home, product details, product listing, cart, order, and user management (if applicable) are developed step-by-step.
    * CSS is used extensively for hover effects, transitions, and background styling.

**Execution Plan**

The project will be developed in a step-by-step manner:

1. **Spring Boot Development:** Begin with backend development, establishing entities, controllers, and database connections.
2. **Database Setup:** Configure MySQL, create tables, and establish connections with the backend.
3. **Postman Testing:** Thoroughly test backend APIs using Postman before proceeding with frontend development.
4. **Frontend Development:** Once the backend is confirmed, initiate Angular development, focusing on responsiveness and UI design.
5. **Final Integration:** Integrate the frontend with the backend and ensure all components work seamlessly.
